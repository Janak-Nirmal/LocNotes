LocNotes requires the Locayta Search Mobile framework to
build.  The framework can be downloaded from:

  http://www.locayta.com/ios-search-engine/locayta-search-mobile/locayta-search-mobile

Download the Locayta Search Mobile SDK and mount the DMG.
Copy "LocaytaSearch.framework" to ~/Library/Frameworks/
(i.e. Library/Frameworks/ under your home directory - create
the directory if it doesn't already exist).

LocNotes should now build.
